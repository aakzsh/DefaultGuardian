# Terms and Usage

## Terms

- Traditional default detection systems: Systems that rely on credit scores and other historical data to assess a user's risk of default.
- Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs): A cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a certain piece of information without revealing the information itself.
- Analytical Data based prediction: A method of predicting future events based on historical data and statistical analysis.
- Transaction Score: A score calculated by analyzing a user's historical transaction data, including both credits and debits. It is a measure of the user's creditworthiness.
- ZK Proof Score: A score calculated using ZKPs to prove that a user has sufficient funds to cover a transaction without revealing their account balance.
- Overall Score: A score that is calculated by combining the Transaction Score and the ZK Proof Score. It is a measure of the overall risk of a transaction.
- Central authority: A financial institution, such as a bank, that is responsible for approving or denying transactions.
- Transaction threshold: A score that is set by the central authority. Transactions only proceed if the Overall Score exceeds this threshold.

## Usage

The proposed payment default detection system can be used to:

- Assess the risk of default for a transaction: The system can be used to calculate an Overall Score for a transaction. This score can be used by the central authority to decide whether to approve or deny the transaction.
- Monitor user behavior: The system can be used to monitor user behavior over time. This information can be used to identify users who are at risk of default.
- Prevent fraud: The system can be used to prevent fraud by identifying transactions that are likely to be fraudulent.

The system can be used in a variety of applications, including:

- Online banking: The system can be used to protect online banking transactions from default and failure.
- Mobile payments: The system can be used to protect mobile payments from default and failure.
- E-commerce: The system can be used to protect e-commerce transactions from fraud.
